Step-1:First of all,using Pythagorean Theorem to generate the side lengths of the right angle triangle.
       c2 = a2+b2
       where,
       c - Length of Hypotenuse
       a,b length of two other sides
Step-2:From the above equation,the maximum value that  can take is 1000 and also the same in the case of b, but we an reduce it 		further.

Step-3:After written a program with the limits extending upto 1000, it took less than 1second for the program execution. 

Step-4:the value of c can be written as va2+b2. So the perimeter of can be written as
 	 p = a + b + c
	?p = a + b + va2+b2
	Now consider b = 0 then
	?p = a + 0 + a
	?p = 2a
	So 2a = 1000
	a = 500
	and similarly the proof follows for b also.

step-5:For Pythagorean Triples,check if the value of c is integer and then add it to the perimeter list for further counting if it is 		an integer.

Step-6:At last,After all the iterations are over, i.e after generated all the values of c for a<500 then count the number of instances        of the given element in the list and finally print the most repeated perimeter.
